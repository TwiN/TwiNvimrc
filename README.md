# TwiNvimrc
TwiN's vimrc

This is simply the vimrc that I have built over time. It also contains features that I left there when I was still a beginner, such as a mapping that prevents the user from using the arrows.

It also contains some personal shortcuts, such as:
 - jk  -> faster way to escape 
 - <F1> -> same as escape, I keep hitting <F1> instead of <ESC>..
 - <F2> -> toggles paste mode on/off
 - and a few other typos..
